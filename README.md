## Road Traffic Accident Analysis and Prediction

Welcome to the Road Traffic Accident Analysis and Prediction project! ðŸš—ðŸ’¥

## Overview

This project explores road traffic accidents with the aim of improving road safety measures. Leveraging data science techniques and machine learning algorithms, it delves into accident severity, geographical distribution, and predictive modeling. The insights and models developed through this project are designed to inform and enhance road safety strategies.

## Project Objectives

- **Apriori Algorithm Analysis:** Uncover relationships between variables influencing accident severity.
- **Spatial Analysis and Clustering:** Identify accident hotspots and understand their distribution in regions such as Kingston upon Hull, Humberside, and the East Riding of Yorkshire.
- **Outlier Detection and Assessment:** Apply methods to identify and evaluate unusual entries in the dataset.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Develop and train a classification model to predict fatal injuries from road traffic accidents.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration:** Comprehensive analysis of accident data including severity and geographical aspects.
- **Clustering:** Utilized K-Means clustering to identify and analyze accident hotspots.
- **Outlier Detection:** Identified and assessed unusual data points to refine the dataset.
- **Predictive Models:** Built and evaluated models using Random Forest (RF), CatBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict fatal injuries.
